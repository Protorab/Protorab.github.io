This is the second, improved version of the OCS Fonts.
In this version the form of the several Cyrillic characters
is corrected, izhica is added to the Glagolitic font, and 
finally, the dot and tilde added to the both fonts

The True Type Fonts for Old Church Slavic Cyrillic and
Glagolitic fonts use exactly the same keyboard mapping
This means that you can write a text in Old Church Slavic
Cyrillic script, and simply mark that text and choose
Glagolitic font to get the transcription. This operation can
be done in the opposite direction Glagolitic -> Cyrillic.

The fonts use Russian keyboard mapping. The principle is that
the letters which exist in Russian are at the same places as
in Russian, and those which are not have been assigned to the
numbers (1-0).

The fonts are intended primarily for the Windows, and can be
used in teaching glagolitic scripture. The Croatian version
of the Glagolitic script will be released soon. 

The fonts are product of Translation Experts Ltd. See
readme.txt for the information about other products of
this company, including a free Old Church Slavic
English dictionary.
